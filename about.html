            <p>
                My ability to empower students is the most rewarding aspect of my 10
                years as a student affairs and higher education professional. I find I
                am at my best when working to develop policy structures and strategic
                initiatives in order to create the highest quality educational
                experiences for students, staff, and faculty alike.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe data tells a story and uncovers solutions to problems. Using
                both qualitative and quantitative methods, I use research to bridge the
                gap between theory and praxis. I examine the application of higher
                education policy in a digital learning context, specifically focusing on
                the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and massive open online courses, more commonly
                referred to as MOOCs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am passionate about creating public policy through the lens of ethics, equity, accessibility, and
                social
                justice. I also strive to make connections between students, policy makers, and education practitioners.
            </p>

            <p>
                I mostly recently worked at MIT in the Division of Student Life. I hold a Masters of Education in Higher
                Education, and earned a Doctorate in Law and Public Policy (D.LP.) from Northeastern University in June
                2016.
