In a December 2018 [announcement](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/12/03/devos-promises-innovation-accreditation-reform-will-alternative-providers-bite), Secretary DeVos stated her agenda will promote “innovation” in higher education, including evaluating current accreditation process. Some skeptics suggest this strategic phrasing may be code for reducing or eliminating [federal oversight](https://www.chronicle.com/article/DeVos-Outlines-a-Vision-for/245369) in postsecondary education. However many education policy professionals recognize the need to update accreditation standards to meet the demands of 21st Century students and changing job market—like transitioning from measuring institutional inputs to assessing student outcomes such as graduation rates and student loan default rates.

This announcement is well timed considering Congress’ commitment to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, the law that gives [accreditation ](https://michellelessly.com/2019/04/05/understanding-accreditation-the-basics)its status in American postsecondary education, by the end of this year. The political climate is ripe for reform, and regardless of DeVos’ intentions, students may stand to benefit from an emphasis on innovation and a critical review of how quality is measured in colleges and universities.

But, can policy makers _actually_ innovate accreditation? If so, what can students, educators, institutions, and accrediting agencies expect to change?

**What could accreditation innovation look like for traditional colleges and universities?**

**Does accreditation innovation benefit alternative education platforms, like coding boot camps or distance learning programs?**

DeVos is open to signing off on new forms of education and credentialing, including alternative platforms, however it is unclear what accreditation offers these companies. The carrot and stick incentive baked into accreditation is having access to federal student aid. Since they currently do not qualify for accreditation and therefore cannot receive federal funds, the majority of alternative platforms currently on the market have developed business plans focused on offering lower-cost credentials, membership-based programs, and income share agreements (ISAs) to generate revenue.

So far, these models have primarily attracted older students, professionals looking for a career change or [income boost](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2018), who may not necessarily need federal funds to pay for such a program. However, accrediting alternative platforms will open up these less expensive education options to individuals who want to use GI Bill money or Pell Grants, and thereby simultaneously diversifying the tech industry and creating new revenue streams for the platforms.

In addition to access to federal student aid, accreditation also offers legitimacy, or at least the signaling thereof. Some alternative platforms, namely MOOCs, struggle to perform due to skepticism of the utility of their credentials in the job market. Without an external quality control assessor deeming these platforms a valid educational option, they may only continue to flounder. However, boot camps with ISAs like General Assembly and Holberton are incentivized to produce employable alumni. Since these platforms are unable to collect on the ISA until their outgoing students find employment, they must continually design their programs to meet the needs of the job market. Thus industry functions as the accreditor, offering both utility in the boot camp credential for students and quality assurance for the platform.
