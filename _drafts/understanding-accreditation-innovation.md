In a December 2018 [announcement](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/12/03/devos-promises-innovation-accreditation-reform-will-alternative-providers-bite), Secretary DeVos stated her agenda will promote “innovation” in higher education, including evaluating current accreditation process. Some skeptics suggest this strategic phrasing may be code for reducing or eliminating [federal oversight](https://www.chronicle.com/article/DeVos-Outlines-a-Vision-for/245369) in postsecondary education. However many education policy professionals, regardless of DeVos’ intentions recognize the need to update accreditation standards to meet the demands of 21st Century students and a changing job markets.

This announcement is well timed considering Congress’ commitment to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, the law that gives [accreditation ](https://michellelessly.com/2019/04/05/understanding-accreditation-the-basics)its status in American postsecondary education, by the end of this year. The political climate is ripe for reform, and students may stand to benefit from an emphasis on innovation and a critical review of how quality is measured in colleges and universities.

But, can policy makers _actually_ innovate accreditation? If so, what can students, educators, institutions, and accrediting agencies expect to change?
