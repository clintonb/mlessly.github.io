Last week, I explored the [basics of accreditation](https://michellelessly.com/2019/04/05/understanding-accreditation-the-basics) in an effort to better understand the role quality assessment plays in the rising cost of college and the possibility of reform in light of recent concerns regarding accountability and transparency in American higher education. In its current state, accreditation caters to traditional institutions, restricting access to alternative platforms for those students who rely federal student aid to further their education.

However, In a December 2018 [announcement](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/12/03/devos-promises-innovation-accreditation-reform-will-alternative-providers-bite), Secretary DeVos stated her agenda will promote “innovation” in higher education, including evaluating current accreditation process. Some skeptics suggest this strategic phrasing may be code for reducing or eliminating [federal oversight](https://www.chronicle.com/article/DeVos-Outlines-a-Vision-for/245369) in postsecondary education. Regardless of DeVos’ intentions, many education policy professionals recognize the need to update accreditation standards to meet the demands of 21st Century students and a changing job markets.

This announcement is well timed considering Congress’ commitment to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, the law that gives accreditation its status in American postsecondary education, by the end of this year. The political climate is ripe for reform, and students may stand to benefit from an emphasis on innovation and a critical review of how quality is measured in colleges and universities.

But, can policy makers _actually_ innovate accreditation? If so, what can students, educators, institutions, and accrediting agencies expect to change?

**What could accreditation innovation look like for traditional colleges and universities?**

Barring the removal of federal regulation or oversight, accreditation innovation for traditional colleges and universities will probably resemble reform more than advancement. Institutions and educators may anticipate a shift in focus: from measuring institutional inputs to assessing student outcomes such as graduation rates and student loan default rates. Doing so will promote accountability as an output of accreditation, and underwrite the relationship between accreditation and student financial aid.
