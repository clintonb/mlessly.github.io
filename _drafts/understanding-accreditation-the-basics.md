title: 'Understanding Accreditation: The Basics'
body: |-
  America’s higher education system is as wide reaching as it is diverse. Its ability to cater to the needs of disparate student populations means it characteristically unique, but also makes is challenging to impose quality controls. Accreditation functions as the primary vetting mechanism for postsecondary institutions, and has done so for centuries in the United States. Over time, accreditation has shifted from serving as an indicator of institutional legitimacy to a principle component the higher education funding ecosystem.

  Congress’s work on reauthorizing the Higher Education Act is now [raising bipartisan concerns](https://www.educationnext.org/college-accreditation-explained-ednext-guide-how-it-works-whos-responsible/) about the efficacy of accreditation. Many Americans recognize that accreditation is vital to the operations of any college or university, but few students, parents, or even educators fully understand how it works, what it accomplishes, or how it impacts tax payers. Failing to grasp the influence accreditation has within the postsecondary education systems can lead to bad outcomes for all constituencies involved. However, this can be avoided by learning about the basics of the accreditation process.
