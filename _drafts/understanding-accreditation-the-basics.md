title: 'Understanding Accreditation: The Basics'
body: |-
  America’s higher education system is as wide reaching as it is diverse. Its ability to cater to the needs of disparate student populations means it characteristically unique, but also makes is challenging to impose quality controls. Accreditation functions as the primary vetting mechanism for postsecondary institutions, and has done so for centuries in the United States. Over time, accreditation has shifted from serving as an indicator of institutional legitimacy to a principle component the higher education funding ecosystem.

  Congress’s work on reauthorizing the Higher Education Act is now [raising bipartisan concerns](https://www.educationnext.org/college-accreditation-explained-ednext-guide-how-it-works-whos-responsible/) about the efficacy of accreditation. Many Americans recognize that accreditation is vital to the operations of any college or university, but few students, parents, or even educators fully understand how it works, what it accomplishes, or how it impacts tax payers. Failing to grasp the influence accreditation has within the postsecondary education systems can lead to bad outcomes for all constituencies involved. However, this can be avoided by learning about the basics of the accreditation process.

  **When did institutions start seeking accreditation?**Accreditation dates back to the [colonial era](https://pacrao.org/b/general/the-regulatory-triad-and-united-states-higher-education/) in the United States. Private universities, like Yale, received charters from the Crown in an effort to indicate legitimacy and a government sanctioned responsibility to enforce quality assurance mechanisms. After the Revolutionary War, oversight of educational institutions shifted primarily to the states, establishing the regulatory and budgeting system still in place today. The Morrill Land Grant Act (1862) parceled out federal land to states for the purpose of building public universities with the expectation these schools would maintain agriculture, military, and engineering programs. The Morrill Act was one of the first acts of federal intervention and regulation over postsecondary institutions.

  As the nation grew after the Revolutionary War, so too did the demand for higher education. Colleges and universities, recognizing the need to set quality assurance standards, created membership associations in which they determined assessment criteria and established peer-review practices. The credibility conveyed by these associations, now called accrediting agencies, was acknowledged by the federal government via the G.I. Bill, making enrollment at an accredited institution a condition for veterans who received these funds.

  The Higher Education Act of 1965 cemented the role of accreditation agencies as industry gatekeepers. Students could only receive federal student aid if they attended an accredited university, meaning institutions would have access to a new, generous revenue stream if they sought out recognition from these agencies. Though refined over a number of HEA reauthorizations, the role of accreditation remains primarily the same today as it was in 1965.

  **How does accreditation work?**Colleges and universities are accredited by one of three types of agencies: regional, national, or specialized/professional. Regional is widely considered to be the most rigorous and therefore more prestigious. The [majority ](https://www.educationnext.org/college-accreditation-explained-ednext-guide-how-it-works-whos-responsible/)of both public (96%) and private schools (69%) receive regional accreditation, but national accreditors still recognize 40% of postsecondary institutions, primarily faith-based or technical colleges. Specialized/professional agencies focus their efforts on certifying schools within colleges and universities, such as medical schools, engineering programs, etc.

  Accreditation is completely voluntary, only made compulsory through the granting of federal student aid. It involves a multistep process, beginning with an application and institutional self-study. This internal audit demonstrates the school’s ability to meet the U.S. Department of Education’s (ED) [requirements](https://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg13.html) for accreditation, including curriculum, compliance with Title IV, and fiscal management. Once completed, the application and self-study are submitted to the agency. A committee of volunteers from member institutions will conduct a peer-review of the self-study and application. The agency will then send a group, also comprised of volunteers, to conduct a site visit. Only after all of these previous steps are completed will the agency review the materials and determine if it will renew or decline the school’s accreditation status.

  Institutions must undergo this process every 5-10 years once accredited in order to ensure quality standards are met continually. The initial accreditation application and process can take up to 6 years to complete, depending upon the agency.
