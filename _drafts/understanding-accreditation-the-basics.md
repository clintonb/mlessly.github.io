title: 'Understanding Accreditation: The Basics'
body: "America’s higher education system is as wide reaching as it is diverse. Its
  ability to cater to the needs of disparate student populations means it characteristically
  unique, but also makes is challenging to impose quality controls. Accreditation
  functions as the primary vetting mechanism for postsecondary institutions, and has
  done so for centuries in the United States. Over time, accreditation has shifted
  from serving as an indicator of institutional legitimacy to a principle component
  the higher education funding ecosystem.\n\nCongress’s work on reauthorizing the
  Higher Education Act is now [raising bipartisan concerns](https://www.educationnext.org/college-accreditation-explained-ednext-guide-how-it-works-whos-responsible/)
  about the efficacy of accreditation. Many Americans recognize that accreditation
  is vital to the operations of any college or university, but few students, parents,
  or even educators fully understand how it works, what it accomplishes, or how it
  impacts tax payers. Failing to grasp the influence accreditation has within the
  postsecondary education systems can lead to bad outcomes for all constituencies
  involved. However, this can be avoided by learning about the basics of the accreditation
  process.\n\n**When did institutions start seeking accreditation?**\n\nAccreditation
  dates back to the [colonial era](https://pacrao.org/b/general/the-regulatory-triad-and-united-states-higher-education/)
  in the United States. Private universities, like Yale, received charters from the
  Crown in an effort to indicate legitimacy and a government sanctioned responsibility
  to enforce quality assurance mechanisms. After the Revolutionary War, oversight
  of educational institutions shifted primarily to the states, establishing the regulatory
  and budgeting system still in place today. The Morrill Land Grant Act (1862) parceled
  out federal land to states for the purpose of building public universities with
  the expectation these schools would maintain agriculture, military, and engineering
  programs. The Morrill Act was one of the first acts of federal intervention and
  regulation over postsecondary institutions.\n\nAs the nation grew after the Revolutionary
  War, so too did the demand for higher education. Colleges and universities, recognizing
  the need to set quality assurance standards, created membership associations in
  which they determined assessment criteria and established peer-review practices.
  The credibility conveyed by these associations, now called accrediting agencies,
  was acknowledged by the federal government via the G.I. Bill, making enrollment
  at an accredited institution a condition for veterans who received these funds.\n\nThe
  Higher Education Act of 1965 cemented the role of accreditation agencies as industry
  gatekeepers. Students could only receive federal student aid if they attended an
  accredited university, meaning institutions would have access to a new, generous
  revenue stream if they sought out recognition from these agencies. Though refined
  over a number of HEA reauthorizations, the role of accreditation remains primarily
  the same today as it was in 1965.\n\n**How does accreditation work?** \n\nColleges
  and universities are accredited by one of three types of agencies: regional, national,
  or specialized/professional. Regional is widely considered to be the most rigorous
  and therefore more prestigious. The [majority ](https://www.educationnext.org/college-accreditation-explained-ednext-guide-how-it-works-whos-responsible/)of
  both public (96%) and private schools (69%) receive regional accreditation, but
  national accreditors still recognize 40% of postsecondary institutions, primarily
  faith-based or technical colleges. Specialized/professional agencies focus their
  efforts on certifying schools within colleges and universities, such as medical
  schools, engineering programs, etc.\n\nAccreditation is completely voluntary, only
  made compulsory through the granting of federal student aid. It involves a multistep
  process, beginning with an application and institutional self-study. This internal
  audit demonstrates the school’s ability to meet the U.S. Department of Education’s
  (ED) [requirements](https://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg13.html)
  for accreditation, including curriculum, compliance with Title IV, and fiscal management.
  Once completed, the application and self-study are submitted to the agency. A committee
  of volunteers from member institutions will conduct a peer-review of the self-study
  and application. The agency will then send a group, also comprised of volunteers,
  to conduct a site visit. Only after all of these previous steps are completed will
  the agency review the materials and determine if it will renew or decline the school’s
  accreditation status.\n\nInstitutions must undergo this process every 5-10 years
  once accredited in order to ensure quality standards are met continually. The initial
  accreditation application and process can take up to 6 years to complete, depending
  upon the agency.\n\n**Who accredits the accreditors?**\n\nToday, accreditation functions
  as one-third of what is known as the [regulatory triad](https://pacrao.org/b/general/the-regulatory-triad-and-united-states-higher-education/).
  State and federal governments make up the other two components of the triad, providing
  oversight to both the accreditation process and the agencies themselves.\n\nUnder
  the authority of the Higher Education Act (1992 reauthorization), the National Advisory
  Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, also known as [NACIQI](https://sites.ed.gov/naciqi/authority/),
  issues accreditation-related guidance to the ED. Comprised of 18 appointed members,
  appointed by the Secretary of Education, the House, and the Senate, NACIQI sets
  the criteria on which accreditors assess postsecondary institutions, determines
  which accrediting agencies are recognized by the ED, and mediates the relationship
  between institutions and their state licensing procedures. NACIQI requires accrediting
  agencies to undergo review every 5 years, in which agencies must demonstrate their
  compliance with the ED’s requirements. NACIQI currently recognizes over 60 accreditors,
  including regional, national and specialized/professional agencies."
