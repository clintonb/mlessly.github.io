title: 'Understanding Accreditation: The Basics'
body: |-
  America’s higher education system is as wide reaching as it is diverse. Its ability to cater to the needs of disparate student populations means it characteristically unique, but also makes is challenging to impose quality controls. Accreditation functions as the primary vetting mechanism for postsecondary institutions, and has done so for centuries in the United States. Over time, accreditation has shifted from serving as an indicator of institutional legitimacy to a principle component the higher education funding ecosystem.

  Congress’s work on reauthorizing the Higher Education Act is now [raising bipartisan concerns](https://www.educationnext.org/college-accreditation-explained-ednext-guide-how-it-works-whos-responsible/) about the efficacy of accreditation. Many Americans recognize that accreditation is vital to the operations of any college or university, but few students, parents, or even educators fully understand how it works, what it accomplishes, or how it impacts tax payers. Failing to grasp the influence accreditation has within the postsecondary education systems can lead to bad outcomes for all constituencies involved. However, this can be avoided by learning about the basics of the accreditation process.

  **When did institutions start seeking accreditation?**Accreditation dates back to the [colonial era](https://pacrao.org/b/general/the-regulatory-triad-and-united-states-higher-education/) in the United States. Private universities, like Yale, received charters from the Crown in an effort to indicate legitimacy and a government sanctioned responsibility to enforce quality assurance mechanisms. After the Revolutionary War, oversight of educational institutions shifted primarily to the states, establishing the regulatory and budgeting system still in place today. The Morrill Land Grant Act (1862) parceled out federal land to states for the purpose of building public universities with the expectation these schools would maintain agriculture, military, and engineering programs. The Morrill Act was one of the first acts of federal intervention and regulation over postsecondary institutions.
