The Biden Administration’s [proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/upshot/student-debt-forgiveness-biden.html) to forgive student loan debt may alleviate some of the burden for borrowers but still leaves future students without a way to keep from getting into debt in the first place.

The idea of [free college](https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/high_school_and_beyond/2019/05/4_things_you_need_to_know_about_free_college_proposals.html), made popular by Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, is an appealing option for those who want to alleviate student debt all together. However, these proposals are limited in scope to public colleges and universities, leaving the [26% of students who attend private universities](https://educationdata.org/college-enrollment-statistics) without debt relief. Additionally, these plans often only account for the cost of tuition, rather than the costs of attendance (COA), which includes fees, room and board, textbook and supplies, and transportation and living expenses. Depending upon where a student lives, these costs can add up to be more than their tuition bill.

How then can we make college more affordable for all students while still accounting for the total COA? By taking students out of the lending process.

The ED spends [$120 billion](https://studentaid.gov/about) every year in federal student aid. [$30 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/235374/expenditure-on-federal-pell-grants-in-the-us/) of those in the form dollars are awarded in the form of Pell Grants, the ED’s most popular needs-based tool to reduce the cost of college. What if these funds were given directly to colleges and universities, on a per student basis, as a federal investment in higher education rather than as a component of a student aid program?

When a student takes out a federal student loan, known in the industry as Title IV funds, the money is sent directly to their institution at the beginning of the term, and is often spent as soon as it is received. From an institutional perspective, the students are simply a means to an end to receive a consistent cash flow of federal funds. This begs the question: why is a student loan even necessary in the first place?

Retooling the Title IV program in this manner comes with a number of benefits for both institutions and students:

* Eliminating the need for FAFSA: Notoriously complicated and overly burdensome for many students, the FAFSA helps the ED determine how much aid a student may be eligible to receive based upon their financial need. Allocating money per student to each institution rather than requiring the student to prove they need aid saves time, a lot of hassle and administrative overhead. Moreover, getting rid of the FAFSA has been a [popular idea for some time](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/upshot/fafsa-follies-to-gain-a-student-eliminate-a-form.html?rref=upshot), but has failed to get traction in light of more pressing policy issues.
* Allows institutions to hand out more financial aid:
